# Contributing guidelines

## Local development

1. install nix with flakes enabled
1. install direnv
1. run `direnv allow .` in the root of the project

## Issues

When making an issue, please be as specific as possible.
Include a minimal reprodicble example for a bug.
I love new ideas, so please share them with me!

## Commit practices

The dev flake automatically configures pre-commit for you.
Please don't make commits without validation.
I never bother with commit messages, so you don't have to either.
Please save your effort for writing good PR descriptions.
